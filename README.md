# Split 4x4 Slides

Convert 4x4 pdf slides to 1x1 by cropping each quarter of each slide.
If the slides have a border then the resulting slides aren't even and symmetrical.

Created because I have a lecturer that loves giving us 4x4 slides (for printing purposes) and not responding to our requests for 1x1 slides because who prints in 2020.
